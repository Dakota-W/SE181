                    24 interlocking checkers; 12 red and 12 black<br>
                    Each player places his twelve checkers on the black square of the first three rows on opposite ends of the board.

                <p>
                    To capture all of the opponent's men, or block them so they cannot be moved. The checkers are moved diagonally and each player moves alternately one of his men, in order to 'capture' and opponen'ts checker, he must be able to jump (with his own man) over his opponent's checker when there is a vacant square behind. Single men may move diagonally forward. When a checker has reached the last row of his opponent's side, it becomes 'King' and then may move diagonally forward or backward. The 'King' is 'crowned' by placing another checker on top of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are allowed to jump as many of the opponent's men on the same move if there are vacant squares diagonally behind. Where there is a 'jump' available, the opponent must jump.
